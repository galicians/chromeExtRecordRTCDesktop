Imagine a world where your phone, TV and computer could all communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat and peer-to-peer data sharing to your web application. That's the vision of WebRTC.

Want to try it out? WebRTC is available now in Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox. 

The team of StackOverTube has made this app available in the Google store to give you the possibility to screencast your computer screen.

You can find the extension at:
